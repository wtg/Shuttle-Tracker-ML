MODULE 1:
AI: the effort to automate intellectual task normally performed by human.
    - Can computer think aside from hard coding?
    - AI was just implemented rules
    - stimulating intellectual human behavior
    - Machine learning is part of AI:
        - Figure the rules for human from data
        - goal is to raise the accuracy
        - Neural Network/ Deep Learning: a formed of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data
            - data is going to transform into different layers
            - multiple layers(usually only input and output layer for ML)
            - Multi stage information extraction process
            - not modeled after the brain (biological inspiration)
        - Diffeent type of Machine Learning:
            - Unsupervised Learning:
                - only have some features for the model to come up with the label
                - create different groupings for the features (cluster data points)
            - Supervised Learning:
                - Have some feature that refers to some sort of labels(pass through model)
                    - Have both informations (to train the model)
                - Regression
                - Classification
            - Reinforcement Learning:
                - don't have any data, only have an agent, an environment, and a reward
                - positive reward to encourage certain action, and negative reward to dicourage incorrect action
                - agent goal is to maximize the amount of reward
                - explore to figure out the environment
    - Data: key thing to create models

    MODULE 2:
    Tensorflow: Open source Machine Learning Library
        - allow people to create without deep mathmatical backgroud
        - biggest Machine Learning library
        - Graph: variables get added to the graph
        - nothing is stored
            - state the computation that we defined
            - different computation can be relate to each other
        - Session: a way to excute different aspect of the graph (evaluate)
            - may be unable to use value because we didn't do session
